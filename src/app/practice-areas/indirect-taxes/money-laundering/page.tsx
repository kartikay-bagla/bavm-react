        General impression is that “Money Laundering” term is used as it converts dirty money, commonly known as Black Money into clean money, commonly known as White Money. The word “Laundering” means washing/cleaning hence here also it is to switch Dirty Money into Clean Money. Clean Money is money coming from legal sources while Dirty Money is money comes from illegal resources/activities.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-center mb-8">
        Dirty Money is also known as Number Two money and White Money is known as Number One money.  Converting of Black Money into white money is call Money Laundering. Money Laundering is an act to conceal the identity of tainted proceeds so that illegally obtained proceeds to become legitimate/ untainted money.

        There is history behind the word “Laundering”. Al Capone, notorious mafia in USA, obtained lot of money from criminal activities by establishing laundries all over USA. Laundry business is a cash business and he converted his cash money into legitimate money hence the name “Money Laundering” came in picture.

      <p className="text-lg text-center mb-8">
        The problem became more acute when the money is used for wrong activities. To prevent such activities and conversion of Black Money into White Money, the Parliament Enacted the Act known by the name “Prevention of Money Laundering Act,2002”.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-center mb-8">

      </p>
