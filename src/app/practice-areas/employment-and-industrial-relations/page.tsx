        In India, we have multiple Labour & Industrial laws related with Legislations Governing the Industrial Relations; the Wages; the Working Hours, Conditions of Service and Employment; the Equality and Empowerment of Women; the Deprived and Disadvantaged Sections of the Society and the Social Security.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-center mb-8">
        These laws are also important because they enable businesses to devote more of their focus to productivity and profitability rather than giving constant energy and resources to problem-solving.
